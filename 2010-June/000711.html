-&lt;h3&gt;eLua Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the official &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt;
-FAQ!&lt;br /&gt; 
-It is assumed that you already know &lt;a href=&quot;overview.html#whatis&quot;&gt;what &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt;
-is&lt;/a&gt;, so here's a list of questions (and their answers) that you might find useful.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;ul&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#minimum&quot;&gt;What are the minimum requirements for eLua?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#learnlua&quot;&gt;How can I learn Lua? Is it hard?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#helpelua&quot;&gt;How can I help eLua?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#comercial&quot;&gt;Can I use eLua in my comercial, closed source project?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fast&quot;&gt;Is eLua fast enough?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#portability&quot;&gt;Since I'm using the &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt; generic platform modules (uart, spi, pwm, tmr...), can I trust my peripheral code to run the same on all my platforms?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#luaversions&quot;&gt;What's the deal with floating-point Lua and
-  integer-only Lua?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#wincomp&quot;&gt;Is it possible to compile eLua under Windows?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#windows&quot;&gt;All your tutorials give instructions on how to compile eLua under Linux, yet you seem to use a lot of Windows tools. How come?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#cygwin&quot;&gt;Will you ever post instructions about how to compile toolchains under Cygwin in Windows?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#bytecode&quot;&gt;I know that Lua can be compiled to bytecode, so I compiled one of the eLua examples with luac and tried to run it on my eLua board, but it didn't work. Is this a bug in eLua?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#outofmemory&quot;&gt;I get &quot;out of memory&quot; errors when I run my Lua programs, what should I do?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#rotables&quot;&gt;I enabled the LTR patch, but now all my module tables (math, io, string, spi and so on) are read only. Do I have to disable LTR if I want write access to these modules?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
-&lt;/ul&gt;
-
-&lt;hr /&gt;
-
-&lt;a name=&quot;minimum&quot; /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the minimum requirements for eLua?&lt;/h2&gt;
-&lt;p&gt;It's hard to give a precise answer to this, because this is not only
-dependable on the footprint of &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt; or it's resource requirements but
-on the final user applications as well. As a general rule, for
-a 32-bit CPU, we recommend at least 256k of Flash and
-at least 64k of RAM. However, this isn't a strict requirement. A
-stripped down, integer-only version of eLua can definitely fit in 128k
-of Flash and depending on your type of application, 32k of RAM might
-prove just fine. We have built &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt; for targets with less than 10K
-RAM but you can't do much than blinking an LED with them. It really largely depends on your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;a name=&quot;learnlua&quot; /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can I learn Lua? Is it hard?&lt;/h2&gt;
-&lt;p&gt;Lua is a minimalistic language (yet incredibly powerful!) which is quite easy to learn. 
-Once you understand the basic concepts you'll find yourself writing 
-  Lua programs in notime. The main resource is the &lt;a href=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.lua.org/">http://www.lua.org/</A>&quot;&gt;Lua homepage&lt;/a&gt;. In the 
-  &lt;a href=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.lua.org/docs.html">http://www.lua.org/docs.html</A>&quot;&gt;documentation page&lt;/a&gt; you'll find the reference manual and the first version of the excellent
-  &quot;Programming in Lua&quot; book. We recommend purchasing the second version of this book, since it's likely that this is all you'll ever need to learn
-  Lua. Another very good resource is the &lt;a href=&quot;<A HREF="http://lua-users.org/wiki/">http://lua-users.org/wiki/</A>&quot;&gt;Lua wiki&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more help, check the 
-  &lt;a href=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.lua.org/community.html">http://www.lua.org/community.html</A>&quot;&gt;community page&lt;/a&gt;. Lua has a very friendly and active community.
-  Most of all, Lua is FUN to learn and use :)&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;a name=&quot;helpelua&quot; /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can I help eLua?&lt;/h2&gt;
-&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt; has many ambitious goals, so it would be great to have more people working on it. Take a look at the 
-  &lt;a href=&quot;status.html#roadmap&quot;&gt;roadmap page&lt;/a&gt; and if you see something there that you'd like to work on, don't hesitate to 
-  &lt;a href=&quot;overview.html#contacts&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;. Also, if you'd like to make a donation to the project (money, or maybe a development board) 
-  rest assured that wwe won't say no :) It also helps a lot if you test &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt; on your own board and you find a bug or an
-  incomplete feature. Or if you just thought about a cool feature that you'd like to see in &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt;.
-  If so, feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;overview.html#contacts&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;a name=&quot;comercial&quot; /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can I use eLua in my comercial, closed source project?&lt;/h2&gt;
-&lt;p&gt;Starting with version 0.6, &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt; is distributed under a MIT license, so you can use it in your closed source projects. Prior to
-this, it was 
-   distributed under GPL, which restricted its usage to open source applications. Be careful though,
-   because &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt; includes some
-   (few) 3rd party libraries,
-   each with its own licensing terms that might be more restrictive than MIT. See &lt;a href=&quot;overview.html#license&quot;&gt;the eLua license&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt; 
-
-&lt;a name=&quot;fast&quot; /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is eLua fast enough?&lt;/h2&gt;
-&lt;p&gt;This pretty much depends on what you expect. If you expect your Lua code to run as fast as your compiled C code, this won't happen, simply because C 
-  is a compiled language, while Lua is an interpreted language. That said, you'll be happy to know that Lua is one of the fastest interpreted languages 
-  out there and also compiles it's programs to bytecodes for it's own
-  virtual machine to execute. If you really need both high speed and Lua, you can (very
-  easily in &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt;) write your speed critical code sections in C and export them as a Lua module. 
-  This way you get the best of both worlds.&lt;br /&gt;
-   We don't have any official benchmarks about Lua speed on embedded devices but you might want to check the TV-B-Gone example on the &lt;a href=&quot;examples.html&quot;&gt;examples page&lt;/a&gt;. TV-B-Gone is a &quot;software remote control&quot; application coded directly in &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt;. 
-  If you're familiar with the remote control protocols, you'll know that this kind of application is quite &quot;real time&quot; and delays in the order of 
-  milliseconds or even less can make your software remote control fail. Yet this sample runs without problems on a 50MHz
-  Cortex-M3 in Thumb2 mode CPU. This should 
-  give you a fairly intuitive view on the speed of &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt;. Of course,
-  the project benefits from the incredible speed and performance of Lua.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;a name=&quot;portability&quot; /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Since I'm using the eLua generic platform modules (uart, spi, pwm, tmr...), can I trust my peripheral code to run the same on all my
-  platforms?&lt;/h2&gt;
-&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, no. While &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt; brings an unprecedent level of
-  source code portability to the embedded world and makes it possible to have a common code on different platforms using the &lt;a href=&quot;arch_platform.html&quot;&gt;platform interface&lt;/a&gt;,
-  it can't possibly provide the same functionality on all platforms, since all MCUs are not created equal. It is very recommended 
-  (and many times imperative) to have an understanding of the peripherals on your particular MPU before you start writing your code. 
-  This, of course, is not particular to &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt;, but it's especially important since the platform interface might give the impression that it 
-  offers an uniform functionality over all platforms, when in fact the only thing in common is often just the interface itself (that is, the methods and 
-  variables you can access in a given module). &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt; tries to help here by giving you an error when you try to access a physical resource that is 
-  not available (for example a timer, a PWM channel, or a PIO pin/port), but it doesn't try to cover all the possible platform-related issues, since this 
-  would increase the code size and complexity too much. These are some caveats that come to mind (note that these are only a few examples, the complete 
-  list is much longer):&lt;/p&gt;
-&lt;ul&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Timers&lt;/b&gt;: some CPUs, like the Luminary Cortex CPUs, have rock solid 32-bit timers. You can do pretty much 
-  everything you need with them. Most platforms have only 16-bit timers though, which imposes some limits on the range of delays you can achieve with them. 
-  Make sure to use &lt;a
-  href=&quot;en_refman_gen_tmr.html#tmr.getmindelay&quot;&gt;tmr.getmindelay(id)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a
-  href=&quot;en_refman_gen_tmr.html#tmr.getmindelay&quot;&gt;tmr.getmaxdelay(id)&lt;/a&gt; to check the actual resolution of your timers and adapt your code accordingly. To 'compensate' 
-  for this, it's not possible to change the base timer frequency on the Cortex CPUs, but it is possible on most other platforms :) So be sure to also check 
-  the result of &lt;a
-  href=&quot;en_refman_gen_tmr.html#tmr.setclock&quot;&gt;tmr.setclock(id)&lt;/a&gt;.
-  Important: when using timers, remember that if you're using XMODEM and/or the &quot;term&quot; module, one of them (generall TMR0) is
-  also used by both of them. So, if 
-  you change the TMR0 base clock in your code, be sure to restore the original setting before returning to the &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt;
-  shell.&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;PWM&lt;/b&gt;: the Cortex-M3 CPUs have 6 PWM channels, but channels 0/1, 2/3 and 4/5 respectively share the same base clock setting. So, when you're
-  changing the base clock for channel 1, you're also changing the base clock for channel 0; if channel 0 was already running, you won't like
-  what will happen next. This time no &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt; function can save you. You simply need you know your CPU architecture.&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;GPIO&lt;/b&gt;: only some platforms have internal pullups for the GPIO pins (others might also have pulldowns). However, in this case you're safe, as 
-  &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt; will signal an error if you try to execute a pull-up/dn operation on a platform that does not support it.&lt;/li&gt;
-&lt;/ul&gt;
-&lt;p&gt;The lesson here is clear: understand your platform first!&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;a name=&quot;luaversions&quot; /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What's the deal with floating-point Lua and integer-only Lua?&lt;/h2&gt;
-&lt;p&gt;Lua is built around a number type. Every number in Lua will have this type. By default, this number type is a double. This means that even if your 
-  program only does integer operations, they will still be treated as
-  floating-point doubles. On embedded platforms this can be a problem, since the floating point 
-  operations are generally emulated in software and this can be slow. This is why &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt; gives you
-  the choice of &quot;integer only Lua&quot;: a Lua with the default 
-  number type changed to long integer. The advantages are increased speed and smaller code size (since we can force Newlib to &quot;cut&quot; the floating point code from 
-  printf/scanf and friends, which has quite a strong impact on the code size) and increased speed. The downside is that you'll loose the ability to do 
-  any floating point operations (although a separate module that will partially overcome this limitation will be provided in the future).&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;a name =&quot;wincomp /&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is it possible to compile eLua under Windows?&lt;/h2&gt;
-&lt;p&gt;Starting with version 0.7, compiling &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt; under Windows is officialy supported, check &lt;a href=&quot;building_win.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;a name=&quot;windows&quot; /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;All your tutorials give instructions on how to compile eLua under Linux, yet you seem to use a lot of Windows tools. How come?&lt;/h2&gt;
-&lt;p&gt;It's true that we do all the &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt; development under Linux, since we find Linux an environment much more suited for development. At the same
-  time it's true that most of the tools that come with my development boards run under Windows. So we choose to use the best of both world: Bogdan runs 
-  Linux under a &lt;a href=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.virtualbox.org">http://www.virtualbox.org</A>&quot;&gt;VirtualBox&lt;/a&gt; emulator and does everything else under Windows. Dado does everything on 
-  Linux and runs Windows under &lt;a href=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.vmware.com">http://www.vmware.com</A>&quot;&gt;VMWare&lt;/a&gt;. Both options are nice if you master your environment. To make 
-  everything even more flexible, Bogdan keeps his VirtualBox Ubuntu image on an external WD passport disk that he can carry with him wherever he goes, 
-  so he can work on eLua whenever he has a bit of spare time :)&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;a name=&quot;cygwin&quot; /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Will you ever post instructions about how to compile toolchains under Cygwin in Windows?&lt;/h2&gt;
-&lt;p&gt;Bogdan: If I ever have way too much spare time on my hands, yes. Otherwise, no. There are many reasons for this. As I already mentioned, I favour Linux 
-  over Windows when it comes to developing applications. Also, I noticed that the GNU based toolchains are noticeable slower on Cygwin than on Linux, so 
-  experimenting with them can prove frustrating. Also, compiling under Linux and Cygwin should be quite similar, so try starting from my Linux based 
-  tutorials, they might work as well on Cygwin.&lt;/p&gt;
-  
-&lt;a name=&quot;bytecode&quot; /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;I know that Lua can be compiled to bytecode, so I compiled one of the eLua examples with luac and tried to run it on my eLua
-  board, but it didn't work. Is this a bug in eLua?&lt;/h2&gt;
-&lt;p&gt;This is not a bug in &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt;, it's a bit more subtle than that. See &lt;a href=&quot;using.html#cross&quot;&gt;the cross-compile section&lt;/a&gt; for a full discussion
-  about this problem and the right way to do it. Starting with v0.7, it is also possible to automatically build your ROM
-  file system with only compiled (bytecode) code. See &lt;a
-  href=&quot;en_arch_romfs.html#mode&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;a name=&quot;outofmemory&quot; /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;I get &quot;out of memory&quot; errors when I run my Lua programs, what should I do?&lt;/h2&gt;
-&lt;p&gt;There are a number of things you can try to overcome this:&lt;/p&gt;
-&lt;ul&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;enable the LTR patch&lt;/b&gt;: you can get very significant improvements if you enable the LTR patch in your &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt; image. See 
-  &lt;a href=&quot;arch_ltr.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more details about LTR and &lt;a href=&quot;building.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for instructions about enabling LTR.
-  The LTR patch is enabled by default for some target platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;precompile your source to bytecode&lt;/b&gt;: if you use bytecode instead of source code Lua won't need to compile your source, so you save some RAM.
-  Starting with v0.7, it is also possible to automatically build your ROM
-  file system with only compiled (bytecode) code. See &lt;a
-  href=&quot;en_arch_romfs.html#mode&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;try to avoid using too many strings&lt;/b&gt;: strings are immutable in Lua. That means that a statement like &lt;i&gt;s = s .. &quot;\n&quot;&lt;/i&gt; (where s is a string) 
-  will create a new string each time it's called. If this happens a lot (for example in a loop), your memory will quickly run out because of all the
-  strings. If you really need to do frequent string operations, put them in a table and then use 
-  &lt;a href=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#5.5">http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#5.5</A>&quot;&gt;table.concat&lt;/a&gt; to make a string from your table.&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;control Lua's garbage collection manually&lt;/b&gt;: if you're still running out of memory, try calling &lt;i&gt;collectgarbage('collect')&lt;/i&gt; from your code, 
-  which will force a garbage collection and thus might free some memory.&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;use the emergency garbage collector (EGC)&lt;/b&gt;: starting with version 0.7, &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt; integrates Robert Jakabosky's excellent Emergency Garbage Collector
-  (EGC) patch. It can help a lot with low memory problems. See &lt;a href=&quot;elua_egc.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for details on how to use the EGC patch in &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
-&lt;/ul&gt;
-
-&lt;a name=&quot;rotables&quot; /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;I enabled the LTR patch, but now all my module tables (math, io, string, spi and so on) are read only. Do I have to
-  disable LTR if I want write access to these modules?&lt;/h2&gt;
-&lt;p&gt;You don't really have to disable LTR to get write access to your rotables, you can use some simple Lua &quot;tricks&quot; instead. Let's suppose that you need
-  write access to the &lt;b&gt;math&lt;/b&gt; module. With LTR enabled, &lt;b&gt;math&lt;/b&gt; is a rotable, so you can't change its keys/values. But you can use metatables
-  to overcome this limitation:&lt;/p&gt;
-&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;local oldmath = math
-math = { __index = oldmath }
-setmetatable( math, math )
-&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
-&lt;p&gt;This way you can use &lt;i&gt;math&lt;/i&gt; in &quot;write mode&quot; now (since it is a regular table), but you can still access the keys from the original &lt;i&gt;math&lt;/i&gt;
-  rotable. Of course, if you need write access to &lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt; your modules (or to most of them) it makes more sense to disable LTR instead, but from our 
-  observations this doesn't happen in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
