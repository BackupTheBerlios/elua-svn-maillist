 interrupt is generated. A *supported interrupt* is any interrupt that is handled by the platform C code (see link:arch_ints.html[here] for more details).
 
 [red]*IMPORTANT*: before learning how to use interrupt handlers in Lua, please keep in mind that Lua interrupt handlers don't work the same way as 
-regular \(C) interrupt handlers. As Lua doesn't have direct suport for interrupts, they have to be emulated. eLua emulates them using a  queue that is populated with

 interrupt data by the C support code. As long as the queue is not empty, a Lua hook is set to run every 2 Lua bytecode instructions. This hook function is the Lua interrupt 
 handler. After all the interrupts are handled and the queue is emptied, the hook is automatically disabled. Consequently:
 
 * When the interrupt queue is full (a situation that might appear when interrupts are added to the queue faster than the Lua code can handle them) subsequent interrupts are
     ignored (not added to the queue) and an error message is printed on the eLua console device. The interrupt queue size can be configured at build time, as explained

+    link:building.html[here]. Even if the interrupt queue is large, one most remember that Lua code is significantly slower than C code, thus not all C interrupts make
     suitable candidates for Lua interrupt handlers. For example, a serial interrupt that is generated each time a char is received at 115200 baud might be too fast for Lua
     (this is largely dependent on the platform). On the other hand, a GPIO interrupt-on-change on a GPIO line connected with a matrix keyboard is a very good candidate for
     a Lua handler. Experimenting with different interrupt types is the best way to find the interrupts that work well with Lua.
 
 * A more subtle point is that the Lua virtual machine must *run* for the interrupt handlers to work. A simple analogy is that a CPU must have a running clock in order
-    to function properly (and in order to take care of the hardware interrupts). If the clock is stopped, the CPU doesn't run and the interrupt handlers aren't called anymore,

     although the occurence of the interrupt might be recorded inside the CPU. This is the exact same situation with Lua: if the virtual machine doesn't run, the interrupts
     are still recorded in the interrupt queue, but the Lua handler won't be called until the virtual machine runs again. In this case though, the &quot;clock&quot; of the Lua VM is a 
     C function that is executed for every VM instruction. If this function blocks for some reason, the VM instructions are not executed anymore. It's not hard to make

 ------------------------------
 
+Sharing an interrupt between Lua and C
+--------------------------------------
+
+As seen above the eLua interrupt subsystem consists of two parts: the C side interrupt support and the Lua side interrupt support. When an interrupt handler is
+enabled on both sides (C and Lua) the interrupt subsystem knows to enqueue the interrupt for the Lua handler and to call the C interrupt handler directly. When the
+same interrupt (with the same ID) is handled by both the C and Lua code it becomes a *shared* interrupt. Shared interrupts might be problematic in some scenarios.
+To avoid potential issues one should should try to remember a few simple rules:
+
+Always check your resource number.::
+  The Lua side might enable an interrupt for a resource number while the C side might enable the same interrupt for another
+  resource number. The effect of this is that both interrupt handlers (in Lua and C) will be called with both resource numbers (since there is a single interrupt
+  handler per interrupt ID). Thus each side should check for the resource number that it needs before acting on the interrupt.
+
+Disable your Lua handlers when you don't need them anymore.::
+  Starting from the same scenario as above (a shared interrupt with a resource number on the C side and another resource number on the Lua side) let's assume that
+  at some point you don't need to receive interrupts on the Lua side anymore. You might think that calling _cpu.cli_ with the Lua resource number is enough to acomplish this 
+  but this is not the case. Since the C side still has a resource number active your Lua handler will still be called with the resource number from the C side. If you
+  followed the first rule (above) your code will behave as expected but it will run slower because of the interrupt support overhead. To completely inhibit the
+  interrupt handler on the Lua side call _cpu.set_int_handler_ with *nil* for the \'handler' argument. After this the Lua interrupt subsystem will not queue 
+  interrupts for the given interrupt ID and thus the handler won't be called anymore. You can re-enable the handler by calling _cpu.set_int_handler_ with an
+  actual function for the \'handler' argument.
+
+ ::
+  Note that this doesn't hold true for the C side. If an interrupt ID/resource number pair is disabled using _platform_cpu_set_interrupt_ the C side handler will
+  not be called anymore, calling _elua_int_set_c_handler_ with NULL is not needed.
+
+Use cpu.cli and cpu.sei carefully.::
+  The _cpu.cli_ and _cpu.sei_ functions in the link:refman_gen_cpu.html[CPU module] are wrappers for the _platform_cpu_set_interrupt_ function described above.
+  This means that eventually they manipulate hardware interrupts directly. If you disable an interrupt ID/resource number pair (with _cpu.cli_) that is
+  used by the C side the C interrupt handler won't be called anymore and eLua will most likely malfuction. Most of the time this isn't an issue since the Lua
+  code is not supposed to enable/disable interrupts used by the C code. It might become a real issue when Lua and C share the same interrupt ID/resource number pair.
+  In this case it is recommended that the Lua code doesn't call _cpu.cli_ at all, instead it should simply set an interrupt handler and service the interrupt.
+  By contrast, _cpu.sei_ can be called even if the interrupt is already enabled.
