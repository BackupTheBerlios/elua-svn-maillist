+eLua components
+================================================================================
+
+Besides the Lua core, the platform modules (docs/platform_modules.txt) and the
+Newlib 'glue code', eLua uses a number of other code modules (components) for
+extended functionality. This is a great thing if you actually need the whole
+functionality in your code, but otherwise it becomes a waste of memory space. 
+Since eLua was designed to be as flexible as possible, it includes a mechanism 
+that allows the user to select exactly what components he needs. Only the 
+selected components will be part of the eLua image. Please note that this is 
+_not_ a replacement of the platform modules mechanism, the two are complementary
+to each other, since the components are not connected with the platform 
+interface (docs/platform_interface.txt) in any way.
+To use this feature, every platform (src/platform/[name]) must include a file
+named &quot;build.h&quot; that specifies what components should be built for that 
+platform. For example, the LM3S &quot;build.h&quot; file might look like this:
+
+(BEGIN src/platform/lm3s/build.h)
+// Define here what components you want for this platform
+
+#ifndef __BUILD_H__
+#define __BUILD_H__
+
+#define BUILD_XMODEM
+#define BUILD_SHELL
+#define BUILD_ROMFS
+#define BUILD_TERM
+
+#endif
+(END src/platform/lm3s/build.h)
+
+In this case, the XMODEM, SHELL, ROMFS and TERM components will be built. On the
+other hand, the i386 &quot;build.h&quot; will probably have less components:
+
+(BEGIN src/platform/i386/build.h)
+// Define here what components you want for this platform
+
+#ifndef __BUILD_H__
+#define __BUILD_H__
+
+#define BUILD_ROMFS
+#define BUILD_SHELL
+
+#endif
+(END src/platform/i386/build.h)
+
+You don't need to modify any other part of your code, just rebuild your image
+after you made changes to this file (docs/building.txt)
+Below you can find a list of eLua components and their functionality.
+
+XMODEM
+================================================================================
+The XMODEM component enables eLua to receive Lua source files via its shell and 
+execute them (docs/the_elua_shell.txt). If you don't need to use &quot;recv&quot; from the
+shell you can skip this component.
+
+SHELL
+================================================================================
+This enables the build of the eLua shell (docs/the_elua_shell.txt). If you don't
+need the shell, don't enable this component. eLua will execute the &quot;lua&quot; command
+at startup if the eLua shell is not built.
+
+ROMFS
+================================================================================
+If you need to use the ROM file system (docs/the_rom_file_system.txt) enable
+this component, otherwise you can skip it.
+
+TERM
+================================================================================
+The TERM module adds support for ANSI terminals. See docs/terminal_support.txt
+for details. If you don't need it, and if you're willing to miss the opportunity
+of playing hangman in eLua (examples/hangman.lua) you can skip this component :)

+
+Terminal support in eLua
+================================================================================
+
+Besides standard stdio/stdout/stderr support (docs/console_input_output.txt), 
+eLua provides the &quot;term&quot; module to access ANSI compatible terminal emulators. 
+It is designed to be as flexible as possible, thus allowing a large number of
+terminal emulators to be used.
+To use the term module, remember to:
+
+- build it (add BUILD_TERM in your build.h file)
+- build its Lua binding ( add AUXLIB_TERM in your platform_libs.h)
+
+See docs/elua_components.h and docs/platform_modules.txt for details.
+
+To use it, first call the &quot;term_init&quot; function:
+
+(BEGIN inc/term.h)
+...........................
+// Terminal output function
+typedef void ( *p_term_out )( u8 );
+// Terminal input function
+typedef int ( *p_term_in )( int );
+// Terminal translate input function
+typedef int ( *p_term_translate )( u8 );
+...........................
+// Terminal initialization
+void term_init( unsigned lines, unsigned cols, p_term_out term_out_func, 
+                p_term_in term_in_func, p_term_translate term_translate_func );
+(END inc/term.h)
+
+The initialization function gets the physical size of the terminal emulator
+window (usually 80 lines and 25 cols) and three function pointers:
+
+- p_term_out: this function will be called to output characters to the terminal.
+  It receives the character to output as its single parameter.
+- p_term_in: this function will be called to read a character from the terminal.
+  It receives a parameter that can be either TERM_INPUT_DONT_WAIT (in which case
+  the function returns -1 immediately if no character is available) or
+  TERM_INPUT_WAIT (in which case the function will wait for the character).
+- p_term_translate: this function translates terminal-specific codes to &quot;term&quot;
+  codes. The &quot;term&quot; codes are defined in an enum from inc/term.h:
+
+(BEGIN inc/term.h)
+...........................
+  _D( KC_UP ),\
+  _D( KC_DOWN ),\
+  _D( KC_LEFT ),\
+...........................
+  _D( KC_ESC ),\
+  _D( KC_UNKNOWN )  
+...........................
+(END inc/term.h)
+
+By using this function, it is possible to adapt a very large number of &quot;term
+emulators&quot; to eLua. For example, you might want to run eLua in a &quot;standalone
+mode&quot; that does not require a PC at all, just an external LCD display and maybe
+a keyboard for data input. Your eLua board can connect to this standalone 
+terminal using its I/O pins, for example via SPI. By writing the three functions
+described above, the effort of making eLua work with this new type of device is
+minimal, as writing an &quot;ANSI emulation&quot; for your terminal device is not hard.
+For an example, see src/main.c, where these functions are implemented for an
+UART connection with a terminal emulator program running on PC.
+
+&quot;term&quot; functions
+================================================================================
+The &quot;term&quot; component exports its functions to Lua via the &quot;term&quot; module. The 
+methods of the &quot;term&quot; module are presented below.
+
+term.clrscr(): clear the screen
+
+term.clreol(): clear from the current cursor position to the end of the line 
+
+term.gotoxy( x, y ): position the cursor at the given coordinates
+
+term.up( delta ): move the cursor up &quot;delta&quot; lines
+
+term.down( delta ): move the cursor down &quot;delta&quot; lines
+
+term.left( delta ): move the cursor left &quot;delta&quot; lines
+
+term.right( delta ): move the cursor right &quot;delta&quot; lines
+
+Lines = term.lines(): returns the number of lines
+
+Cols = term.cols(): returns the number of columns
+
+term.put( c1, c2, ... ): writes the specified character(s) to the terminal
+
+term.putstr( s1, s2, ... ): writes the specified string(s) to the terminal
+
+Cx = term.cursorx(): return the cursor X position
+
+Cy = term.cursory(): return the cursor Y position
+
+c = term.getch( term.WAIT | term.NOWAIT ): returns a char read from the 
+  terminal. If term.WAIT is specified the function will wait for a character to
+  be ready, with term.NOWAIT it returns -1 if no char is available or the char
+  code if a char is available. The return of getch can be checked against the
+  char codes defined in inc/term.h, by appending &quot;term.&quot; to the constant name 
+  (for example: term.KC_UP, term.KC_LEFT, term.KC_ESC ... )

+The ROM file system
+================================================================================
+
+This is a small, read-only file system built inside eLua. It is integrated with
+Newlib, so you can use standard POSIX calls (fopen/fread/fwrite...) to access
+it. It is also accessible directly from Lua. The files in the file system are 
+part of the eLua binary image, thus they can't be modified after the image is
+built. For the seame reason, you can't add/delete files after the image is built.
+To use this file system:
+
+- copy all the files you need to the files/ directory.
+- Build eLua (docs/building.txt). As part of the build process, &quot;mkfs.py&quot; will
+  be called, which will read the contents of the &quot;files/&quot; directory and will
+  output a file that contains a binary description of the file system.
+- burn your image to the target
+- from your code, whenever you want to access a file, prefix its name with
+  &quot;/rom/&quot;. For example, if you want to open the &quot;a.txt&quot; file, you should call 
+  fopen like this:
+
+  f = fopen( &quot;/rom/a.txt&quot;, &quot;rb&quot; )
+
+  If you want to execute one file from the ROM file system with Lua, simply do
+  this from the shell:
+
+  eLua# lua /rom/bisect.lua
+
+  Or directly from Lua:
+
+  &gt; dofile &quot;/rom/bisect.lua&quot;
+
+The maximum file name of a ROMFS file is 14 characters, including the dot
+between the file name and its extension. Make sure that the file names from
+files/ follow this rule.
