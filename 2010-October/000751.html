-&lt;a name=&quot;whatis&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is eLua?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
-&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;eLua&lt;/strong&gt;
-stands for &lt;strong&gt;Embedded Lua&lt;/strong&gt; and the project
-aims to offer the full implementation of the 
-&lt;a href=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.lua.org">http://www.lua.org</A>&quot;&gt;Lua Programming Language&lt;/a&gt; to the embedded world.
-&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;eLua&lt;/strong&gt;
-is not a stripped down set of Lua to fit in the embedded environment. Much on the contrary, it strives to
-offer the same features as the desktop version of Lua, complementing them with 
-specific features for embedded use and discarting the need of an operating
-system running on the microcontrollers.
-Besides offering different flavors of the full Lua implementation
-(like the possibility of choosing between an integer-only and a floating
-point numbers implementation),
-a lot of work was and will be done in the direction of making Lua
-more &quot;embedded-friendly&quot; by augmenting the core language with features
-that allow lower memory requirements and faster embedded performance.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;Why Lua? Extremely well crafted, Lua is the perfect example of a
-minimal, yet fully functional language. 
-Although generally advertised as a &quot;scripting
-language&quot; (and used accordingly especially in the game industry), it is
-also fully capable of running stand-alone programs and web services 
-(ex: Adobe Lightroom, World of Warcraft, ...). Its limited
-resource requirements make it suitable to a lot of microcontroller
-families. The intrinsic high portability of the original Lua code
-(which is ANSI C and runs virtually on every platform), combined with the highly portable software
-architecture of &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt;, allow for easy porting of the project to a large variety 
-of architectures. The peripheral access libraries/modules exported by &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt; are also portable 
-by design, so one could run a Lua program (without or with very few modifications) 
-on every &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;eLua&lt;/span&gt; supported platform.
-This brings an unprecedent level of portability to the embedded aplications
-world. &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt; inherits the minimalistic and functional design of Lua, staying 
-in line with the well known &lt;b&gt;KISS&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Keep It Small and Simple&lt;/i&gt; philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
-
-&lt;p&gt;The aim of the project is to have a fully functional Lua development
-environment &lt;strong&gt;on the microcontroller itself&lt;/strong&gt;,
-without the need to install a specific development environment on
-the PC side, other than a serial or ehternet console/terminal emulator.&lt;/p&gt;
-&lt;p&gt;We can't end this short presentation without presenting our project motto: No matter what you do with &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt;, always remember to have
-Fun with it :)&lt;/p&gt;
-&lt;br /&gt;
-&lt;br /&gt;
-&lt;a name=&quot;features&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;General Features&lt;/h3&gt;
-&lt;p&gt;As already stated, &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt; allows you to run Lua completely on
-the
-target microcontroller. A fast-growing set of complementary modules is also
-provided, for programming &lt;strong&gt;eLua&lt;/strong&gt; microcontroller's peripherals. &lt;/p&gt;
-&lt;p&gt;The following important features are ready or being implemented:&lt;/p&gt;
-&lt;ul&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;a flexible, configurable build system and a web build service under
-  development.&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;access to the Lua interpreter on the target MCU via a variety of physical transports
-  (RS-232, Ethernet, ...).&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;a (mostly) platform independent MCU peripheral library (PIO,
-  UART, PWM, SPI, TMR, ADC, NET, CAN, DAC, I2C...)&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;a very low footprint embedded ROM file system, easy to port to different types of memory chips and other storage devices&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;a small FAT R/W file system layer for SD/MMC cards&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;a minimal command &quot;shell&quot;, for file operations, environment configuration and other facilities&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;tcp/ip network support&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;remote procedure calls support. Distributed processing in the embedded world&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;an embedded http server&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;extended (romable) Lua types, optimized for embedded performance&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;terminal/console over Serial and Ethernet protocols&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;debugging (directly on the MCU or remotely with the PC)&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;rfs support. Remote file sharing on the embedded world&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;full and stand alone implementation on all MCUs. No dependency on embedded operating systems&lt;/li&gt;
-  &lt;li&gt;online and offline access to (same format) documentation and tutorials&lt;/li&gt;
-&lt;/ul&gt;
-&lt;p&gt;For more information about the functionality (implemented and planned) in &lt;strong&gt;eLua&lt;/strong&gt; check &lt;a
-href=&quot;status.html&quot;&gt;our status page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
-&lt;p&gt;Porting &lt;strong&gt;eLua&lt;/strong&gt; to another compatible platform should be as easy
-and
-painless as possible. Currently this is restricted to platforms for
-which the gcc+newlib combo is available. This restriction will disappear in the near future, as &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt; will have its own libc and thus it will be available on a much
-broader range of MCUs.&lt;/p&gt;
-&lt;p&gt;The Lua implementation is the full desktop Lua version and comes in two flavors: &quot;regular Lua&quot;
-(using
-floating point as the number type) and &quot;integer Lua&quot; (using integers).
-&quot;Regular Lua&quot; will be able
-to perform floating point operations (slower because the
-floating point operations will be emulated in software on the MCU),
-while &quot;integer Lua&quot; will only be able to perform operations with
-integer numbers (but support for fixed and even floating point can be
-added with separate modules) and thus will be faster.&lt;/p&gt;
-&lt;br /&gt;
-&lt;br /&gt;
-&lt;a name=&quot;audience&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Audience&lt;/h3&gt;
-&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;eLua&lt;/span&gt; has a wide and varied audience, starting from newcomers to the embedded world who want an
-easy and powerful environment for prototyping, rapid application
-development and quick production, and ranging towards highly skilled developers
-that want to extend their programs with the Lua library facilities and
-portable features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;eLua&lt;/span&gt;
-allows embedded-oriented programmers to use the simplicity and
-power of the Lua programming language and to hide the low-level
-complexities and platform/architecture-dependent features. With &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt;,
-the programmer can focus on the actual implementation of his program,
-without having to worry about accessing the low-level peripheral 
-configuration and data registers, as the platform libraries already

+[[overview]]
+What is eLua?
+-------------
+
+eLua stands for *Embedded Lua* and the project aims to offer the full
+implementation of the <A HREF="http://www.lua.org[Lua">http://www.lua.org[Lua</A> Programming Language] to
+the embedded world.
+
+eLua is not a stripped down set of Lua to fit in the embedded
+environment. Much on the contrary, it strives to offer the same
+features as the desktop version of Lua, complementing them with
+specific features for embedded use and discarting the need of an
+operating system running on the microcontrollers.  Besides offering
+different flavors of the full Lua implementation (like the possibility
+of choosing between an integer-only and a floating point numbers
+implementation), a lot of work was and will be done in the direction
+of making Lua more &quot;embedded-friendly&quot; by augmenting the core language
+with features that allow lower memory requirements and faster embedded
+performance.
+
+Why Lua? Extremely well crafted, Lua is the perfect example of a
+minimal, yet fully functional language.  Although generally advertised
+as a &quot;scripting language&quot; (and used accordingly especially in the game
+industry), it is also fully capable of running stand-alone programs
+and web services (ex: Adobe Lightroom, World of Warcraft, ...). Its
+limited resource requirements make it suitable to a lot of
+microcontroller families. The intrinsic high portability of the
+original Lua code (which is ANSI C and runs virtually on every
+platform), combined with the highly portable software architecture of
+eLua, allow for easy porting of the project to a large variety of
+architectures. The peripheral access libraries/modules exported by
+eLua are also portable by design, so one could run a Lua program
+(without or with very few modifications) on every eLua supported
+platform.  This brings an unprecedent level of portability to the
+embedded aplications world. eLua inherits the minimalistic and
+functional design of Lua, staying in line with the well known *KISS*,
+_Keep It Small and Simple_ philosophy.
+
+The aim of the project is to have a fully functional Lua development
+environment *on the microcontroller itself*, without the need to
+install a specific development environment on the PC side, other than
+a serial or ehternet console/terminal emulator.
+
+We can't end this short presentation without presenting our project
+motto: No matter what you do with eLua, always remember to have Fun
+with it :)
+
+[[features]]
+General Features
+----------------
+
+As already stated, eLua allows you to run Lua completely on the target
+microcontroller. A fast-growing set of complementary modules is also
+provided, for programming eLua microcontroller's peripherals.
+
+
+The following important features are ready or being implemented:
+
+* a flexible, configurable build system and a web build service under
+  development.
+
+* access to the Lua interpreter on the target MCU via a variety of
+  physical transports (RS-232, Ethernet, ...).
+
+* a (mostly) platform independent MCU peripheral library (PIO, UART,
+  PWM, SPI, TMR, ADC, NET, CAN, DAC, I2C...)
+
+* a very low footprint embedded ROM file system, easy to port to
+  different types of memory chips and other storage devices
+
+* a small FAT R/W file system layer for SD/MMC cards
+
+* a minimal command &quot;shell&quot;, for file operations, environment
+  configuration and other facilities
+
+* tcp/ip network support
+
+* remote procedure calls support. Distributed processing in the
+  embedded world
+
+* an embedded http server
+
+* extended (romable) Lua types, optimized for embedded performance
+
+* terminal/console over Serial and Ethernet protocols
+
+* debugging (directly on the MCU or remotely with the PC)
+
+* rfs support. Remote file sharing on the embedded world
+
+* full and stand alone implementation on all MCUs. No dependency on
+  embedded operating systems
+
+* online and offline access to (same format) documentation and tutorials
+
+
+For more information about the functionality (implemented and planned)
+in eLua check link:status.html[our status page].
+
+Porting eLua to another compatible platform should be as easy and
+painless as possible. Currently this is restricted to platforms for
+which the gcc+newlib combo is available. This restriction will
+disappear in the near future, as eLua will have its own libc and thus
+it will be available on a much broader range of MCUs.
+
+The Lua implementation is the full desktop Lua version and comes in
+two flavors: &quot;regular Lua&quot; (using floating point as the number type)
+and &quot;integer Lua&quot; (using integers). &quot;Regular Lua&quot; will be able to
+perform floating point operations (slower because the floating point
+operations will be emulated in software on the MCU), while &quot;integer
+Lua&quot; will only be able to perform operations with integer numbers (but
+support for fixed and even floating point can be added with separate
+modules) and thus will be faster.
+
+[[audience]]
+Audience
+--------
+
+eLua has a wide and varied audience, starting from newcomers to the
+embedded world who want an easy and powerful environment for
+prototyping, rapid application development and quick production, and
+ranging towards highly skilled developers that want to extend their
+programs with the Lua library facilities and portable features.
+
+eLua allows embedded-oriented programmers to use the simplicity and
+power of the Lua programming language and to hide the low-level
+complexities and platform/architecture-dependent features. With eLua,
+the programmer can focus on the actual implementation of his program,
+without having to worry about accessing the low-level peripheral
+configuration and data registers, as the platform libraries already
+take care of this. This increases productivity and eliminates the
+often frustrating task of dealing with platform-specific drivers.
+
+
+The list below summarizes eLua's target audience:
+
+* Embedded developers that are looking for a fast, easy to use and
+  powerful way of coding.
+
+* First-time embedded programmers (or simply first time programmers)
+  who are looking for an easy way to &quot;dive&quot; into the embedded
+  programming world. eLua is a great learning tool.
+
+* People that aren't really developers, but still want to be able to
+  prototype an embedded system fast and painless, without having to
+  learn C for that.  Embedded developers who need powerful
+  meta-language mechanisms for complex code algorithms and data
+  description.
+
+* Field engineers that can go to their customer site and debug an eLua
+  module on site, without any preparation at all, since the whole
+  development environment resides on chip already.
+
+* Final clients and decision makers, who benefits from the fact that
+  eLua portability transforms hardware into comodities. In systems
+  using eLua, replacing field sensor and actuator controllers by
+  diferent models, brands and architectures have no impact on the main
+  application software.
