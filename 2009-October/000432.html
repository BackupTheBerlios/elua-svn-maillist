   error, it's impossible to run Thumb code from the on-chip flash, you can only run regular ARM code (?!). Also, the board that I got from Olimex completely ignores the fact that this chip can run in DFU mode (it doesn't include 
   any kind of jumper and/or switch to enable this mode), so I had to build a support board for it. Which is something I had to do also because the board doesn't export a RS232 interface, I had to build one around a MAX232 chip. 
   All in all, my experience with this chip (and with the Olimex board) wasn't that pleasant, but this doesn't change the fact that the LPC-H2888 is one of the most powerful (resource-wise) boards on which &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt; runs.
