+- eLua has a global filename size limit of 30 characters, so don't put files with longer names in the shared directory, it might lead to unexpected
   behaviour. 
 - the file sharing &quot;protocol&quot; is an extremely simple one, it doesn't make provisions for error correction and has only very basic error detection. 
   So, if there are serial communication problems on the connection used by RFS, you might encounter RFS errors (timeouts, invalid operations and so on).
