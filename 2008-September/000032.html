+Your build target is specified by two paramters: cpu and board. &quot;cpu&quot; gives the
+name of your CPU, and &quot;board&quot; the name of the board. A board can be associated
+with more than one CPU. This allows the build system to be very flexible. You 
+can use these two options together or separately, as shown below:
+
+- cpu=name: build for the specified CPU. A board name will be assigned by the
+  build system automatically.
+- board=name: build for the specified board. The CPU name will be inferred by 
+  the build system automatically.
+- cpu=name board=name: build for the specified board and CPU.
+
+For board/CPU assignment look at the beginning of the SConstruct file from the 
+base directory, it's self-explanatory.
+
+The other options are as follows:
   
 - target=lua | lualong: specify if you want to build full Lua (with floating 
   point support) or integer only Lua (lualong). The default is &quot;lua&quot;.
-- cpu=at91sam7x256 | at91sam7x512 | i386 | str912fw44 | lm3s8962 | lm3s6965:

 - cpumode=arm | thumb: for ARM target (not Cortex) this specifies the
   compilation mode. Its default value is 'thumb' for AT91SAM7X targets and
-  'arm' for STR9 targets.
+  'arm' for STR9 and LPC2888 targets.
+- allocator = newlib | multiple: choose between the default newlib allocator
+  (newlib) and the multiple memory spaces allocator (multiple). You should
+  use the 'multiple' allocator only if you need to support multiple memory 
+  spaces, as it's larger that the default Newlib allocator (newlib). For more

+eLua generic modules
+================================================================================
+
+Before you read this file, please make sure that you read and understood the 
+theory from &quot;platform_modules.txt&quot; (at least the first part which describes
+the platform modules implementation). The generic modules use the exact same
+mechanism. In fact, the only difference between them is that the generic modules
+are exactly what their name implies: generic. They don't depend on the platform
+interface, so they don't need specific support for each platform, but they still
+behave identically on all platforms. They are selected by the same mechanism
+used by the platform modules (platform_libs.h). Following is a list of these 
+modules and their exported functions.
+
+The &quot;term&quot; module
+================================================================================
+The &quot;term&quot; component (see terminal_support.txt) exports its functions to Lua via 
+the &quot;term&quot; module. The methods of the &quot;term&quot; module are presented below.
+
+term.clrscr(): clear the screen
+
+term.clreol(): clear from the current cursor position to the end of the line 
+
+term.gotoxy( x, y ): position the cursor at the given coordinates
+
+term.up( delta ): move the cursor up &quot;delta&quot; lines
+
+term.down( delta ): move the cursor down &quot;delta&quot; lines
+
+term.left( delta ): move the cursor left &quot;delta&quot; lines
+
+term.right( delta ): move the cursor right &quot;delta&quot; lines
+
+Lines = term.lines(): returns the number of lines
+
+Cols = term.cols(): returns the number of columns
+
+term.put( c1, c2, ... ): writes the specified character(s) to the terminal
+
+term.putstr( s1, s2, ... ): writes the specified string(s) to the terminal
+
+Cx = term.cursorx(): return the cursor X position
+
+Cy = term.cursory(): return the cursor Y position
+
+c = term.getch( term.WAIT | term.NOWAIT ): returns a char read from the 
+  terminal. If term.WAIT is specified the function will wait for a character to
+  be ready, with term.NOWAIT it returns -1 if no char is available or the char
+  code if a char is available. The return of getch can be checked against the
+  char codes defined in inc/term.h, by appending &quot;term.&quot; to the constant name 
+  (for example: term.KC_UP, term.KC_LEFT, term.KC_ESC ... )
+
+The &quot;pack&quot; module
+================================================================================
+Pack allows packing/unpacking of binary data. For example, it allows one to save 
+a specific data type (for example a 16-bit integer) from Lua to a file and then 
+read it back to a Lua variable without having to worry about the different
+physical representations of a Lua number and a 16-bit integer. It's originally
+written by Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo, one of the &quot;fathers&quot; of Lua.
+It exports just two methods (&quot;pack&quot; and &quot;unpack&quot;), but it uses some format
+specifiers for the pack/unpack operations that take a while to get used to. For
+more information download the original distribution and check its documentation
+and examples (<A HREF="http://www.tecgraf.pub-rio.br/~lhf/ftp/lua/~lpack">http://www.tecgraf.pub-rio.br/~lhf/ftp/lua/~lpack</A>).
+
+The &quot;bit&quot; module
+================================================================================
+As Lua doesn't have built-in operators for bit operations (and, or, xor, not)
+they are provided by this module. It's based on &quot;bitlib&quot; by Reuben Thomas and
+was slightly adapted and augmented for eLua.
+
+Res = bit.bnot( value ): unary negation
+
+Res = bit.band( v1, v2, ... ): binary &quot;and&quot;
+
+Res = bit.bor( v1, v2, ... ): binary &quot;or&quot;
+
+Res = bit.bxor( v1, v2, ... ): binary &quot;exclusive or&quot;
+
+Res = bit.lshift( value, pos ): shift &quot;value&quot; left &quot;pos&quot; positions.
+
+Res = bit.rshift( value, pos ): shift &quot;value&quot; right &quot;pos&quot; positions. The sign is
+  not propagated.
+
+Res = bit.arshift( value, pos ): shift &quot;value&quot; right &quot;pos&quot; positions. The sign
+  is propagated (&quot;arithmetic shift&quot;).
+
+Res = bit.bit( bitno ): a shortcut for bit.lshift( 1, bitno )
+
+Res1, Res2, ... = bit.set( bitno, v1, v2, ... ): set the bit at position &quot;bitno&quot;
+  in v1, v2, ... to 1.
+
+Res1, Res2, ... = bit.clear( bitno, v1, v2, ... ): set the bit at position 
+  &quot;bitno&quot;in v1, v2, ... to 0.
+
+Res = bit.isset( value, bitno ): returns true if bit at position &quot;bitno&quot; in 
+  &quot;value&quot; is 1, false otherwise.
+
+Res = bit.isclear( value, bitno ): returns true if bit at position &quot;bitno&quot; in
+  &quot;value&quot; is 0, false otherwise.
