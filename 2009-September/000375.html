 &lt;p&gt;Lua is a minimalistic language (yet very powerful) which is quite easy to learn. Once you understand the basic concepts you'll find yourself writing 
   Lua programs in notime. The main resource is the &lt;a href=&quot;<A HREF="http://www.lua.org/">http://www.lua.org/</A>&quot;&gt;Lua homepage&lt;/a&gt;. In the

+&lt;a name=&quot;fast&quot; /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is eLua fast enough?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This pretty much depends on what you expect. If you expect your Lua code to run as fast as your compiled C code, this won't happen, simply because C 
   is a compiled language, while Lua is an interpreted language. That said, you'll be happy to know that Lua is one of the fastest interpreted languages 
-  out there. If you really need both high speed and Lua, you can write your speed critical code sections in C and export them as a Lua module. 
-  This way you get the best of both worlds. We don't have any official benchmarks about Lua speed on embedded devices, but you might want to check the

   If you're familiar with the remote control protocols, you'll know that this kind of application is quite &quot;real time&quot;, and delays in the order of 
   milliseconds or even less can make your software remote control fail. Yet this sample runs without problems on a 50MHz Cortex (Thumb2) CPU. This should 
   give you a fairly intuitive view on the speed of eLua.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It's hard to give a precise answer to this. As a general rule for

 &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, no. While &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt; makes it possible to have a common code on different platforms using the &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;##platform interface&lt;/a&gt;,

 &lt;p&gt;Lua is build around a number type. Every number in Lua will have this type. By default, this number type is a double. This means that even if your 
   program only does integer operations, they will still be treated as doubles. On embedded platforms this is a problem, since the floating point 
   operations are generally emulated in software, thus they are very slow. This is why &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt; gives you &quot;integer only Lua&quot;: a Lua with the default

 &lt;p&gt;It's true that we do all the &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt; development under Linux, since we find Linux an environment much more suited for development. At the same

 &lt;p&gt;Bogdan: If I ever have way too much spare time on my hands, yes. Otherwise, no. There are many reasons for this. As I already mentioned, I favour Linux 
   over Windows when it comes to developing applications. Also, I noticed that the GNU based toolchains are noticeable slower on Cygwin than on Linux, so 
   experimenting with them can prove frustrating. Also, compiling under Linux and Cygwin should be quite similar,so try starting from my Linux based 
   tutorials, they might work as well on Cygwin.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This is not a bug in &lt;b&gt;eLua&lt;/b&gt;, it's a bit more subtle than that. See &lt;a href=&quot;using.html#cross&quot;&gt;the cross-compile section&lt;/a&gt; for a full discussion

 &lt;p&gt;You don't really have to disable LTR to get write access to your rotables, you can use some simple Lua &quot;tricks&quot; instead. Let's suppose that you need
   write access to the &lt;b&gt;math&lt;/b&gt; module. With LTR enabled, &lt;b&gt;math&lt;/b&gt; is a rotable, so you can't change its keys/values. But you can use metatables
